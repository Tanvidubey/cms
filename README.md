This C++ program implements a simple Contact Management System (CMS) that allows users to add, display, search, modify, and delete contacts. It stores contact information (ID, name, and phone number) in a text file (contacts_db.txt).

### Features
- Add new contacts with unique IDs.
- Display a list of all stored contacts.
- Search for a contact by ID.
- Modify an existing contact's name and phone number.
- Delete a contact from the database.
